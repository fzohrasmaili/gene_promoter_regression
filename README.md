# gene_promoter_regression

This poject aims to use a regression deep learning model to predict value of a matrix representing gene expression values based on matrix factorization.

**Tuned_alastor_test.ipynb** : Notebook to run regression model. 

**models.py**: deep learning model architectures.

**functions.py** : set of fuinctions for data pre-processing/graph plotting.

**Neural_Motif_Discovery_14.ipynb**: We apply AI explanability to discover relevant motifs in the genome sequences based on the trained model.
